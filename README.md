### Homework
* Don't forget to fill up the Weekly Journal! https://forms.gle/QAe9Dm54xNwUxZqZA
##### Basic
1. "refactor" your plotting code to work on the dataset as loaded by from sklearn.datasets import load_{yourdatasetname}
2. perform classification/regression on your dataset using Linear regression/Logistic regression, as applicable, and print performance
##### Advanced
1. perform classification/regression (for the question you asked in the first week) on your dataset using KNeighborsClassifier or KNeighborsRegressor, as applicable, and print the performance. This can be done through the instructions in [scipy lectures for scikit-learn](http://scipy-lectures.org/packages/scikit-learn/index.html#introduction-problem-settings)
2. test the perfomance of your model using different values for the parameter n_neighbors
##### Reach
1. use 1+ other types of classifier/regressors in scikit-learn for answering your question. (check the section About choosing the best algorithms https://cce-bigdataintro-1160.github.io/CEBD-1160-fall-2019-site/8-ml.html for ideas)
2. using comments, describe the classifiers/regressors you're using (that'd be to do a very short research on how the algorithms you're using works) (edited)
